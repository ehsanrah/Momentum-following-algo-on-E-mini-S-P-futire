This algo is written in C# program.
It follows the momentum after breaking out from a price channel.
It is a algo designed to trade ES E-mini future contracts. 
It is designed to trade from 09:30 am EST to 4:00 pm EST (york regular trading hours). 
To use it you need to hook it up with your brokerage API. 
I am using ninjatrader/8 to run this algo. 
Number of contracts per trades, profit target and stop loss can be fed as an input. 
Backtesting results are also included in repository. Enjoy!
